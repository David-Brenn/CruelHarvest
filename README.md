# CruelHarvest
Cruel Harvest is a game where you play as a farmer in the second world war. It is a mixture of farming simulator, horror game and maybe story game (not shure yet)
The game is inspired from ["All Quiet on the Western Front"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp1fK8fK0qY&ab_channel=EarlofSandwich%21). 

# Game Play 
Your task is to grow your fram to take care of your family. Now and then a solider tires to steal something from your farm. Therefore you need to listen and watch carefully to protect your farm. The soldiers are mostly stronger than you but often they dont want to harm you. Some of them dont hasetae to use their wepons to get something to eat. The invades sould feel like hunt showdown. Very slow and sounds are very important. It should be possible to spend money to get better weapons and traps. 

Aside to the horrorish/action gameplay you will focus mainly on farming. You need to take care of plants, animals and your farm in general. Look for inspiration form farming games that are set in medival age or arround 1945. 

Farming:
 - Corn
 - Animals (Da gooooose)
 - Tidy up (Weather dmg / War dmg)

Action:
 - Traps (Bells/Cans)
 - Different Lights
 - Enemy

# Inventory
You should only be able to carry 2 or 3 tools. Tools include weapons. This means you have to choose carefully what items you are equiping. Also for usable items like something to heal or seeds there should be a carry limitation. Here i think of 5-10 items 


# Graphic Style
I would like to achive a feeling link in hunt showdown or metro exodus, but i know that realistic graphics needs a lot of time. Therefor i frist choose a simple art style for the developing phase. Most likely just low poly style. 

# Tools
Developing will be done in unity. 
Concepts and Inspiration will be done with ["figma"](https://www.figma.com/file/RAObIrPi6llWKlwQeb4ZYc/CruelHarvest?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=OiS0Pa7XcZKzv0nY-0)
